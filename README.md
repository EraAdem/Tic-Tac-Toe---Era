 # Description


Tic Tac toe game is a popular game where players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either one player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally;
or all nine squares are filled. If a player is able to draw three of their Xs or three
of their Os in a row, then that player wins.

This is my first project and it was a challenge to have a functional tic tac toe game.
