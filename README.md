 ## Description

Tic Tac toe game is a popular game where players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either one player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally;
or all nine squares are filled. If a player is able to draw three of their Xs or three
of their Os in a row, then that player wins.


## Planning Story

This is my first project from scratch and it was a challenge to have a functional tic tac toe game. I began this project by building the board in HTML.
Then I built the user authentication forms for sign-up/in/out and change password. After authenticaion was verified as working, I moved on to creating the game logic.
Looking back, when I was building the game logic, this part was not easy and at times I was feeling nervous but I did enjoy building this game from scratch and I look forward to future projects.



## User Stories


1. As a user I want to have a functional game.
2. As a user I want to sign in/up.
3. As a user I want to start a new game.
4. As a user I want to change password.
5. As a user I want to get the number of games played.
6. As a user I want to have an interactive and visually interactive interface.
7. As a user I want to have a functional game.

## Technologies Used

1. Javascript
2. jQuery
3. AJAX
4. DOM
5. HTML
6. CSS

### Unsolved Problems

Would like to eventually work for the design.
